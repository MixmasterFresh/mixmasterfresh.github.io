				<p>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering <br>
					 student at Purdue University.</p>
			</header>
			<p>I am originally from the California Bay Area, but I am currently in Indiana as a member of the Purdue Class of 2018, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I've been programming for a few years, and have <a href="#projects">built a few projects</a> over the years. Mostly I've been following my passions and discovering where my interests do, and do not, lie. What I have found over the years is that I am really interested in many different things, and the work I do over the years reflects that.</p>

						<h4>The Unknown Programming Language</h4>
						<p>Over the years, I have found that there does not exist a programming language that can do all that I want a programming language to do. Because of this I have decided that over the course of many years I will build a new programming language. If you would like to fill out a survey to help me plan the language, you can do so <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/4s7GWLtyZZ">here</a>(also accepting ideas for names).<br><a href="#">Read More...</a></p></p>

			<h3>Kick-ass Projects</h3>
			<p>Over time I've built a number of projects, so as I put them on github or add descriptions for them, I will add them to my projects page. Keep in mind, the nature and technical difficulty of these projects changes as my interests do. Below are some of my favorites.</p>

				<li class="fa-code-fork" style="width: 100%">Moxtra API prize winner at Hack The North</li>
					<p>My team at Hack the North, a Hackathon in Waterloo, Canada, made an application that facilitated the creation of software applications for non-profits through volunteer developers. My team was able to pitch our idea to Y-Combinator Partners and Alumni and receive feedback. You can see our project page <a href="http://devpost.com/software/hopensource">here</a> or read my blog post <a href="#">here</a>(as soon as I write it.)</p>
				<li class="fa-heartbeat" style="width: 100%">Finalist in Sudden Impact Wearables Design Competition</li>
					<p>I was one of seven finalists in the Sudden Impact Wearables Design Competition put on by element14.com where finalists made prototype systems to help monitor athlete safety through wearable sensors.</p>
				<li class="fa-code" style="width: 100%">Winner of the Indy Civic Hackathon, IPS Access to Education Challenge</li>
					<p>As a part of this challenge, my team developed a ruby on rails application that facilitated the application process for Indianapolis Public Schools magnet schools.</p>
				<li class="fa-terminal" style="width: 100%">Second Place in the Purdue Bloomberg Codecon Competition</li>
					<p>The competition consisted of a field of more than 90 people working individually to solve 8 programming problems over 2 hours. The top three qualified for the national competition.</p>
